Description: A Shiny app designed to test verbal memory and collect user data. The program
    presents random English nouns that are either one, two, or three syllables in length. 
    The user can choose how long to spend and how many words to try to memorize. Then, in 
    the intermediate panel, a distractor task is used where a random number of circles is 
    plotted and the user must count the circles and answer accurately. Lastly, the user 
    recites the words he/she rememebers by typing and submitting words one by one. The 
    program scores words using the Levenshtein distance and a typo tolerance which varies 
    with the number of syllables. The scoring function also checks if the user repeated words and scores for only 
    the first occurance. User data is then outputted to a .csv file.
