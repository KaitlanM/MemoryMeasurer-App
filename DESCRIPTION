Description: A Shiny app designed to test verbal memory and collect user data. The program presents random English nouns
    that are either one, two, or three syllables in length. The user can choose how long to spend and how many words to try
    to memorize. Then, in the intermediate panel, a distractor task is used where a random number of circles is plotted
    and the user must count the circles and answer accurately. Lastly, the user recites the words he/she rememebers by 
    typing and submitting words one by one. The program scores words using the Levenshtein distance and a typo tolerance
    which varies with the number of syllables. The scoring function also checks if the user repeated words and scores for only 
    the first occurance. User data is then outputted to a .csv file.
